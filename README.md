Presentation framework for the NES

My goal for this project is to create a framework that can be used to create presentations for the NES. It should include simple next/previous navigation with the D-pad, support at least 3 layouts (full-screen text, full-screen image, and image with accompanying text), and transitions between slides using horizontal or vertical scrolling. As a stretch goal I'd like to add music/SFX and animation, as well as fun transitions making use of per-scanline background position changes.

I have some experience with NES dev, more from the ROM hacking side of things where everything starts working and I slowly break/change it over time. My personal goals for this project are to learn to import binary data and build basic image/text displays.
